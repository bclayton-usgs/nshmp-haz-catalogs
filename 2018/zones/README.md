## CEUS Maximum Magnitude Zones

These files demarcate the seismotectonic regions of the central and eastern U.S. Each zone has an associated 4-branch logic tree of maximum magnitude (mMax). These zones are derived from the seimotectonic zones [used in 2014](), but similarly characterized polygons have been consolidated and the default zone has been explicitely defined.

> TODO consolidate all other polygons that are used to carve up catalogs and set rate floors.
